Redis Template

What Is Redis?
 - Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. 
 - In terms of implementation, Key-Value stores represent one of the largest and oldest members in the NoSQL space. 
 - Redis supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets with range queries.
